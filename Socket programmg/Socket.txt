#Background
Socket is one of the important aspect in computer networking. Socket allows communication between two devices either on same or different network. The socket is the most primitive, fundamental type provided by the operating system to communicate over the network. A socket represents a single connection between exactly two pieces of software (a so-called point-to-point connection). Socket programming is a programming schema in which sockets are used and manipulated to create a connection between software. Socket programming is used with instant messaging, Internet browsers, file sharing programs, and anything that forces the computer to connect to a system. Socket programming involves using a list of commands to connect a socket from one computer to another. For example, for an instant messenger program to work, it must connect to a second computer. To make this connection, a socket is employed. By forging the connection, the two computers are now able to link together and speak to one another.
# Procedure and Method
Following are the key points that are used this project:
1.	Creating a Socket
2.	Binding Socket and Connections
3.	Accepting Connections
4.	Sending Commands 
5.	Clint Server Connection 
6.	Python Socket Client
7.	Testing Locally 

For socket programming, server.py and client.py file is created. The IP address of server is bound to client's file. And the same port is used in both client and server file so that client and server establishes connection between them. The system module is imported so that it creates the same environment as command prompt. Using this system module, the server can read,write and overwrite the files of client PC's. This creates a new environment for both server and client to establish connection and remotely access the files and modify them. It is used to rectify, scan and debug the problems that client PC's face.
